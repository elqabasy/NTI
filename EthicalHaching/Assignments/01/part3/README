Title: Explain Part3 in detail




How did using multiple sources affect the results?
	Sol.
	- we will make a test incrementaly, like appending one engine for the test
		ex: 
		recon#1 -b bing
		recon#2 -b bing,shodan
		recon#3 -b bing,shodan,duckduckgo
		and so on
		# result_format=$sources_count.json
		
	- then make a multiple-sources-affect.statistics
		format:
		source_count, founded_hosts_count, founded_ips_count, founded_emails_count

	- then compare results and sort them and we have to conclude that,
		* as the number of sources increase, the number of results increase

	Lab:
	
	But Unfor., i don't have all api keys; so the statistics will not be accurate.
	
		
	
	
Are there duplicate entries across engines? How can you filter or clean that?
	Sol.
	- By default, theHarvester automaticly deduplicate result, but it may happen
		with tools like sublist3r, subfinder, and amass.

		What about solution for those tools?
		Real Example:
		
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/01/part3/deduplication/recon]
		└─$ subfinder -all -d $(cat ../../../target) > subdomains.dup

		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/01/part3/deduplication/recon]
		└─$ cat subdomains.dup| wc -l
		1708

		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/01/part3/deduplication/recon]
		└─$ sort -u ./subdomains.dup > subdomains.nodup
		                                                                             
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/01/part3/deduplication/recon]
		└─$ wc -l ./subdomains.nodup 
		1699 ./subdomains.nodup

		WE HAVE DEPLICATED 9 DOMAINS.


DONE!
