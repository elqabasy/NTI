Step-by-Step Instructions:


Part 1: Introduction and Tool Familiarization
	Open your Kali terminal.
	Run the following command to ensure theHarvester is installed and updated:
	sudo apt update && sudo apt install theharvester
	theHarvester -h


Review the help menu to understand the various flags.

Part 2: Basic Usage
	Run theHarvester against a public domain of your choice (not a real target you don't have permission to test).
	For example: tesla.com, microsoft.com, huawei.com
	theHarvester -d tesla.com -b bing -l 100
	Questions to answer:
	What types of information did you find?
	List all emails and subdomains you retrieved.
	Which source engine gave the most useful results?

Part 3: Multi-source Data Collection
	Run the tool again using multiple sources and save the results:
	theHarvester -d tesla.com -b google,bing -l 200 -f tesla_report.html
	 Questions to answer:
	How did using multiple sources affect the results?
	Are there duplicate entries across engines? How can you filter or clean that?

Part 4: Analysis and Documentation
	Based on your findings, assess:
	How much internal data (like employee names or emails) was exposed?
	Could an attacker use any of this data in phishing or social engineering attacks?



Final Report Must Include:
	Target Domain
	Tools and Commands Used
	List of Emails / Subdomains / IPs Found
	Screenshots of Terminal Output
	Brief analysis: What did you learn?

Bonus Challenges (Optional for Advanced Students)
	Subdomain Enumeration:
	Compare theHarvester results with another tool like Sublist3r or amass. Do they match?
