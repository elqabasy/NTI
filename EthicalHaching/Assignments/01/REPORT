## Introduction
This report documents the reconnaissance and information gathering performed on the target domain `rlp.de` as part of the NTI Ethical Hacking course. The assignment focused on using theHarvester and other OSINT tools to enumerate emails, subdomains, IP addresses, and related assets.

## Methodology
- Installed and verified theHarvester (v4.8.2) on Kali Linux.
- Explored theHarvester's help menu and options for optimal usage.
- Conducted scans using multiple search engines and sources.
- Saved all findings in structured JSON files for analysis.
- Documented the process and results in dedicated READMEs for each assignment part.

## Findings
- Discovered a range of IP addresses, emails, and subdomains associated with the target.
- All emails and subdomains are stored in: `./most-useful-engine/results/*.json`.
- Multi-source data collection increased the breadth of results, as detailed in `part3/README`.
- Deduplication was handled by theHarvester, with additional notes on other tools.
- Summary statistics:
    - Emails: 20
    - IP Addresses: 59
    - Hosts/Subdomains: 2338
    - ASNs: 11

## Analysis
- Internal data exposure includes employee emails and infrastructure details.
- The data collected could be leveraged for phishing or social engineering attacks.
- TheHarvester proved effective, especially when combining multiple sources.
- See screenshots in `/assignments/01/media` for terminal outputs and tool results.

## Conclusion
The assignment objectives were met with a thorough approach to OSINT and documentation. The process was informative and highlighted the importance of multi-source reconnaissance and data validation. All steps, findings, and analysis are available in the respective directories and files for review.
