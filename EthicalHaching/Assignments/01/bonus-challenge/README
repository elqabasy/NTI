Compare theHarvester results with another tool like Sublist3r or amass. Do they match?
	SOl.
	- Before we start we have to put a baseline for all tools,
		we will compare only the output of subdomains not anything other.


	- Second, we have to save the outputs in this format: tool_name.recon

	- Thisrt, we have to count every subdomains for every tool, after doing
		Filteration on the outputs

	- Then make a table that show differences and duplicates
	


	Now we have a statistic:
	┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/bonus-challenge]
	└─$ wc -l ./subfinder sublist3r theHarvester 
	  2338 theHarvester
	  1641 ./subfinder
	    40 sublist3r
	  
	  4019 total
	

	- And when combining them together we got:
	┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/bonus-challenge]
	└─$ cat ./subfinder sublist3r theHarvester| sort -u | wc -l
	3391

	[@] Thats very powerfull!
