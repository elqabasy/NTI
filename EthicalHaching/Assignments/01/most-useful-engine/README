# TIP: GO TO `Phase03` to see the final statistics.



Phase01: Run theHarvester with every engine in ./sources
	- The output is *.json
	- We will put their paths into ./paths	
	
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/most-useful-engine]
		└─$ find ./results -type f -iname "*.json" -exec echo {} >> paths \;
		
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/most-useful-engine]
		└─$ cat paths | wc -l
		43
		
		
Phase02: Count Domains, IPs, and emails for every file
	- iterate through ./paths file and count all entities
		then output them to ./statistics
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/most-useful-engine]
		└─$ cat ./paths| xargs -I{} sh -c 'path=$1 && echo "$path $(jq -r .hosts[] $path | wc -l) $(jq -r .emails[] $path | wc -l)" >> ./statistics' _ {}

	- Then sort ./statistics files based on count of hosts, and emails
		┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/most-useful-engine]
		└─$ cat ./statistics| sort  -k2,3 -r | head -n 10
		./results/rapiddns.json 687 0
		./results/yahoo.json 59 18
		./results/urlscan.json 51 0
		./results/subdomaincenter.json 482 0
		./results/crtsh.json 424 0
		./results/hackertarget.json 422 0
		./results/bing.json 21 1
		./results/otx.json 155 0
		./results/duckduckgo.json 11 0
		./results/certspotter.json 1 0
		
	- SO, we conclude that the most important info got from yahoo, 
		with 18 exposed email addresses

Phase03: Statistics
	- Top 3 (criteria: exposed hosts based):
	┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/most-useful-engine]
	└─$ cat statistics | sort -k2  -r -n | head -n 3
	./results/rapiddns.json 687 0 0
	./results/subdomaincenter.json 482 0 0
	./results/crtsh.json 424 0 0


	- Top 3 (criteria: exposed emails):
	┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/most-useful-engine]
	└─$ cat statistics | sort -k3  -r -n | head -n 3
	./results/yahoo.json 59 18 0
	./results/bing.json 21 1 0
	./results/zoomeye.json 0 0 0


	- Top 3 (criteria: exposed ip addresses):
	┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/EthicalHaching/Assignments/01/most-useful-engine]
	└─$ cat statistics | sort -k4  -r -n | head -n 3
	./results/otx.json 155 0 39
	./results/urlscan.json 51 0 35
	./results/zoomeye.json 0 0 0
	
DONE!
