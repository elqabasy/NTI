Windows Backdoor Task
Part 1: Initial Access & Payload Delivery
Offensive Concept: Creating and delivering a malicious payload to establish an initial foothold.


   1. Create the malware file using msfvenom:
   msfvenom is a powerful tool for generating payloads. 
   The windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload is designed to create an encrypted, interactive shell connection back to the attacker's machine.

   2. Use python http.module to open a web server & download the malware:
   This simulates the delivery mechanism. 
   Attackers often host the malware on a simple server and rely on social engineering (phishing, drive-by downloads) to trick the user into executing it.



Part 2: Establishing Control
Offensive Concept: Setting up the command and control (C2) infrastructure to receive the connection.


   1. Open the listener on msfconsole (exploit/multi/handler):
   This module is the "server" component. 
   It waits for the payload on the target machine to connect back. 
   Once the connection is established, the attacker gains a Meterpreter session—an advanced, interactive shell.


Part 3: Post-Exploitation
   Offensive Concept: Maintaining persistence, expanding access, and achieving the attack's goal.

      1. Privilege Escalation
      * Check your current privileges.
      * Identify privilege escalation vectors.
      * Execute an appropriate method to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

      2. Dump User Credentials
      * Retrieve NTLM hashes from the system.
      * Extract plaintext credentials using an appropriate tool.

      3. Create a New User
      * Add a new user with administrative privileges.

      4. Enable Remote Access (RDP and SSH)
      * Enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
      * Enable SSH.
      * Add the newly created user to the allowed users for both of them.

      5. Make the Backdoor Persistent
      * Ensure the backdoor remains active after reboot.


DONE TIL HERE.
Part 4: Covering Tracks
   Offensive Concept: Removing forensic evidence to hinder detection and attribution.


   1. Clear Event Logs
   meterpreter > clearev
   
   2. Delete Exploit Artifacts
   meterpreter > rm C:\path\to\exploit.exe
   
   3. Hide User Creation (Bouns)
   Hide the newly created user from the login screen
   Deliverables
   * Step-by-step documentation of your process.
   * Screenshots of all steps and successful execution.
   * Explanation of the tools and techniques used.
   * Analysis of potential detection and defense mechanisms (Bouns).
